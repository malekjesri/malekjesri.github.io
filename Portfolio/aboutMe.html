<h2>About me</h2>
<img src="malekpic.jpg" alt="Malek picture">
<p>My Name is Malek Jesri, I am a Informatics Student at UC Irvine. I enjoy playing video games in my free time<br>
(Currently Rainbow 6 Siege is my go to). I also enjoy cooking. I also just bought an ice cream machine and<br>
am making home Ice Cream. I don't really enjoy coding even easy stuff like this, my passion is to one day be<br>
an elementary school teacher but we'll see. I want an A on this assignment and in this class. Will anyone even read this part> <br>
Are you reading this MS or MR TA??????? Is my writing all this just a waste of time. Honestly I think im gonna post this website<br>
if I can make it look nicer. So if you are a potential employer I am not crazy. I promise.</p>
